## About this talk ...

::: columns

- We learn best through **doing**, not just listening. 
:::
::: {.fragment}
- We will focus on just two themes: **Achievement** and **Action**.

## Clear Learning Outcomes

- Provide a roadmap for the session/course/workshop
- The class knows what to expect and can prepare
- Onboard the class - we do it in new jobs so why not in a learning environment?

## Understand your audience

-Course participants will already have their own experience 
  -we want to build on that, not teach them what they already know. 
-Assess their motivation. 
  -Try a pre-survey to get participant experience and tailor your delivery. 
-Encourage constant feedback 
  - listen to it and pivot if needed. Direct the audience to what kind of feedback will be helpful.

## Relevance

No vague tutorials - embrace abstraction. Think of the real-world challenges that students might face.

## Abstraction {auto-animate="true"}

``` {.python code-line-numbers="2|4|5|8"}
# Function definition is here
def foo( arg1, arg2 ):
   # Divide and return"
   bar = arg1 / arg2
   return bar;

# Now you can call sum function
bar = foo( 10, 20 );
```

## Abstraction {auto-animate="true"}

``` {.python code-line-numbers="2|4|5|8|10"}
# Function definition is here
def epilepsyIncidence( numEpilepsy, Population ):
   # Divide and return"
   RateRatio = (numEpilepsy / Population)*1000
   return RateRatio;

# Now you can call sum function
IncidenceRate = epilepsyIncidence( 10, 5145 );

print "The Incidence Rate Ratio for Epilepsy is : ", IncidenceRate, "per 10,000"
"The Incidence Rate Ratio for Epilepsy is : 19.4 per 10,000"
```

## Action

::: {.fragment}
- Absorbing knowledge is important, but acting on it re-enforces learned material
:::
::: {.fragment}
- We should aim to minimize the time between learning a concept and practicing it.
:::
::: {.fragment}
- Try to jump into an interactive Minimal Working Example (MWE) as often as possible
:::
::: {.fragment}
- I try to stick to 20 minutes theory with MWEs followed by 30 mins practical
:::

## Instant gratification
::: {.fragment}
- Instant gratification is a powerful vehicle for learning
  - Even after 15 years of coding I celebrate when my code works!
:::
::: {.fragment}
- (Easy) Practice examples also allows us to fail (gracefully) and learn from mistakes
  - This is why I can't do DIY...

## Learning Environment

- A consistent learning environment that is easy to use
- Keeps a tight focus for you to control the environment
  - I recommend open source cloud based solutions where possible
- Can self assess and understand how they are learning

## Kaggle for Data Science and Machine Learning



## Collaboration

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Set the tone and expectations for collaborative sessions
  - Code of conduct
  - Set clear goals for sessions
- Try and pair up participants that will learn from eachother

- Some ideas:
  - Discuss the benefits and potential harms of using digital technology to attempt to detect dementia 20 years early
  - Create a COVID Dashboard that tracks new cases by variant over time
  - GitHub Pull Request Practice

## Future Learning

- Move the participants towards independence in the topic
- Set them up to succeed
- Recommend learning materials that will build on the course and challenge them
  - Tailor by discussing their motivations for enrolling on the course/workshop
  
## Absolute Position

Position images or other elements at precise locations
